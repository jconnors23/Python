Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4, 0 3, 1 4 2 5 

init max_average, set to 0, 
init length set to k 

iterate through nums 

    if i + k > len (i):
      continue 
    else:
     calculate = nums[i:i+k]
     sum = 0 
     for num in calculate:
        sum += num
     average = sum / len (calculate)
     if average > max_average:
        max_average = average
return max_average

average equals math library average of nums[i:i+k] - > [1,12,-5,-6]
