Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2

create map of squares of each digit 0 - 9, 
keys are strings of digits while val is the int 
convert n to string, 
get individual digits for lookup, 
convert summed squares back to new
loop through n, 
setting new n equal to 
sum of look up values for num in n 
when n equals len(1), see if that val is equal to 1
