take the list create a map, 
where the keys are the numbers in the list 
and the values are the indexes of each occurence of that number 
in the list
compare these indices to one another 
[double for loop through values list from each given key the map],
 if the absolute value of any two these indices is within <= to k, 
 return true 


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
seen = [] (if nums[val] nums.push else add it )
map_nums = {
    1: [0, 3]
    2: [1]
    3: [2]
}

def compate()

for key in map_nums:
    for i in range(len(map_nums(key)):
        for j in range(len(map_nums(key)):
            if i == j:
                continue 

Output: true
